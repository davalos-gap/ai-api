# E-commerce API Implementation Checklist

This checklist tracks the steps required to implement the E-commerce API proof of concept based on the [specification](spec.md) and [project plan](project_plan.md).

## Phase 1: Basic Project Setup and Model Creation

- [ ] **1.1 Create Category Model**
  - [ ] Create `Models/Category.cs` with Id, Name, and Description properties
  - [ ] Mark Name and Description as required properties
  - [ ] Ensure model matches the structure in `data/categories.json`

## Phase 2: Data Access Layer

- [ ] **2.1 Create Category Service Interface**
  - [ ] Create `Services/ICategoryService.cs` with CRUD operation definitions
  - [ ] Add XML documentation for each method
  
- [ ] **2.2 Implement Category Service**
  - [ ] Create `Services/CategoryService.cs` implementing ICategoryService
  - [ ] Implement file I/O operations for categories.json
  - [ ] Add JSON serialization/deserialization logic
  - [ ] Implement thread safety for file operations
  - [ ] Handle appropriate error scenarios

## Phase 3: Dependency Injection Setup

- [ ] **3.1 Create Service Collection Extensions**
  - [ ] Create `Extensions/ServiceCollectionExtensions.cs`
  - [ ] Implement AddCategoryServices extension method

## Phase 4: API Endpoints Implementation

- [ ] **4.1 Implement GET Endpoints**
  - [ ] Add GET /categories endpoint to Program.cs
  - [ ] Add GET /categories/{id} endpoint to Program.cs
  - [ ] Register services using the extension method
  - [ ] Implement error handling for both endpoints

- [ ] **4.2 Implement POST Endpoint**
  - [ ] Add POST /categories endpoint to Program.cs
  - [ ] Implement validation for required fields
  - [ ] Return 201 Created status code with the new category
  - [ ] Add proper error handling

- [ ] **4.3 Implement PUT Endpoint**
  - [ ] Add PUT /categories/{id} endpoint to Program.cs
  - [ ] Implement validation for category existence
  - [ ] Return appropriate status codes
  - [ ] Add proper error handling

- [ ] **4.4 Implement DELETE Endpoint**
  - [ ] Add DELETE /categories/{id} endpoint to Program.cs
  - [ ] Implement validation for category existence
  - [ ] Return 204 No Content status code if successful
  - [ ] Add proper error handling

## Phase 5: Testing and Refinement

- [ ] **5.1 Create Unit Tests**
  - [ ] Create unit tests for CategoryService
  - [ ] Test all CRUD operations
  - [ ] Test error scenarios

- [ ] **5.2 Create Integration Tests**
  - [ ] Create integration tests for all API endpoints
  - [ ] Test successful and error scenarios
  - [ ] Verify correct status codes and responses

## Verification

- [ ] **Final Testing**
  - [ ] Test all endpoints manually using a tool like Postman or the built-in Swagger UI
  - [ ] Verify data persistence by restarting the application
  - [ ] Ensure all requirements from the specification are met

## Documentation

- [ ] **Update Documentation if needed**
  - [ ] Update [spec.md](spec.md) with any changes made during implementation
  - [ ] Update [project_plan.md](project_plan.md) with lessons learned

## References

- [Specification Document](spec.md) - Contains the detailed API requirements
- [Project Plan](project_plan.md) - Contains the implementation approach and detailed prompts

## Additional Notes

- This is a proof of concept implementation to be completed within one hour
- Focus on functionality over perfect architecture
- No authentication is required for this PoC
- All data is persisted in the categories.json file
